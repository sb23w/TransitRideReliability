To schedule times for all lines in major transit systems, you typically need to gather structured data for each system. Here’s how you can approach it:

1. Use GTFS Feeds (General Transit Feed Specification)
Most major transit systems worldwide use GTFS, which is a standard for sharing public transportation schedules and associated geographic information. GTFS feeds consist of multiple files (in CSV format) that describe transit schedules, stops, routes, and services.

Transit Agencies: Access GTFS data directly from transit agencies like New York’s MTA, London’s TfL, or San Francisco’s SFMTA. Many provide their data publicly on their websites or via dedicated portals like OpenMobilityData.
Example Feeds:
stops.txt: List of transit stops with location information.
routes.txt: List of routes, including bus, train, etc.
trips.txt: Detailed schedule of trips per route.
stop_times.txt: Arrival and departure times for each stop.
2. API Access
Transit APIs: Many transit agencies provide APIs to query schedule data in real-time. For instance:
Google Maps Transit API: Offers schedule and real-time data for public transit systems around the world.
City-Specific APIs: Some cities offer transit APIs, like New York’s MTA and San Francisco’s SFMTA, which allow developers to access route and schedule information.
Open Data Platforms: Check open data platforms for transit APIs, such as:
Delhi's Open Transit Data (OTD) platform
Transport for London (TfL) API.
3. Manually Scraping Data (If Not Available in GTFS Format)
In cases where GTFS feeds are not available, you can consider scraping transit websites that provide schedule information.
Use tools like BeautifulSoup (Python) or Selenium to scrape transit schedules.
4. Database Structure for Schedule Management
To efficiently store and manage transit schedules for all lines:

Tables:
Stops: List of stops with unique IDs and locations.
Routes: List of routes with start, end, and major stops.
Trips: Specific trips (time and route) linked to route and stop IDs.
StopTimes: Mapping of stop times for each trip.
Store scheduled times for all lines and real-time updates for easier querying.
5. Consider Regional Standards
While GTFS is a global standard, some countries like China and India may not fully support it. For these regions, accessing real-time schedules may require leveraging region-specific platforms, APIs, or scraping solutions.

By using GTFS data, APIs, or manual scraping when necessary, you can efficiently schedule transit times for major systems and incorporate them into your application.
